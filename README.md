# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

A Netflix clone constructed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Firebase would provide a robust, user-friendly streaming platform with key features like user authentication, movie browsing, video playback, and personalized watchlists, all while leveraging the strengths of each technology to deliver a smooth user experience.

Key Components and Functionality:
Frontend (HTML, CSS, React):
User Interface: Building the visually appealing layout, including navigation menus, movie carousels, and individual movie detail pages using React components for dynamic rendering and efficient updates.
Data Display: Fetching movie data from a third-party API like TMDB using React's fetch API or Axios, and displaying it in a visually organized manner.
Responsive Design: Implementing CSS media queries to adapt the layout seamlessly across different screen sizes.
Search Functionality: A search bar using React state management to filter movie listings based on user input.

Backend (Firebase):
User Authentication: Utilizing Firebase Authentication to handle user registration, login, and password management, allowing users to create accounts and manage their profiles.
Data Storage (Firestore): Storing user-specific data like watched movies, watchlists, and profile preferences in a flexible NoSQL database like Firebase Firestore.

Core Features to Implement:
Home Screen:
Featured Movie Carousel: Displaying prominent titles with eye-catching visuals.
Category Browsing: Sections for different genres (Action, Comedy, Drama) to navigate easily.
Personalized Recommendations: Using Firestore to store user viewing data and suggest movies based on their preferences.
Movie Detail Page:
Movie Poster, Title, Synopsis
Cast and Crew Information
Trailer Playback (using embedded YouTube videos)
"Add to Watchlist" functionality
